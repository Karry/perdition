# perdition.conf
#
# Sample configuration file for perdition. Format of a line is:
#
# <key> <value>
#
# Key is either a short or long option as per perdition -h|--help, without
# the leading - or --.  Blank lines are ignored, as is anything including
# and after a # (hash) on a line. If a \ precedes a new line then the lines
# will be concatenated.  if a \ precedes any other character, including a #
# (hash) it will be treated as a literal. Anything inside single quotes (')
# will be treated as a litreal. Anything other than a (') inside double
# quotes (") will be treated as a litreal. Whitespace in keys must be
# escaped or quoted. Whitespace in values need not be escaped or quoted.
#
# Options that do not make sense in the configuration file such as h|help
# and f|config_file  are ignored. Options specified on the command line
# override the options in this file.

# -B|--no_bind_banner:
# If -b|--bind_address is specified, then the
# address will be resolved and the reverse-lookup
# of this will be used in the greeting. This option
# disables this behaviour an reverts to using the
# uname to derive the hostname for the greeting

# -b|--bind_address:
# Bind to interfaces with this address.
# In non-inetd mode, connections will only be
# accepted on interfaces with this address. If
# NULL connections will be accepted from all
# interfaces. In inetd and non-inetd mode the source
# address of connections to real servers will be
# this address, if NULL then the operating system
# will select a source address.
# The address may be an IP address or a hostname.
