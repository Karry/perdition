Perdition is allows users to connect to a content-free pop server that will
redirect them to their real pop server.  This enables pop for a domain to
be split across multiple real pop servers on a per user basis.  This can
also be used to as a POP proxy especially in firewall applications.

For more information see man pages distributed with the package.
