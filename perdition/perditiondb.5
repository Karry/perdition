.TH PERDITIONDB 5 "3rd May 2001"
.SH NAME
perditiondb \- perdition modular popmap support
.SH DESCRIPTION
Perdition supports a dynamic library mechanism to access
arbitrary databases that resolve a user to a host and port.
.P
Note: If you are using the \-s|\--default server option then
creating an empty database will cause all users to use
the default server. Alternatively, setting no popmap by passing
an empty string to the \-m|\--map_name option will cause no
map lookups to take place and only the default server to
be used. If in this situation no default server is set then
perdition will still run but users will not be able
to get past authentication.
.SH LIBRARY FUNCTIONS
The database is accessed using the dlopen mechanism on a library.
The library should define the symbol
\fBint (*dbserver_get)(char *, char *, char **, size_t *)\fP
with the following semantics.
.P
.B dbserver_get
.P
Find the server (value) given the user (key)
.TP
.B pre: 
.sp
.B key_str: 
Key as a null terminated string
.sp
.B options_str:
Options string. The usage of this is implementation dependant.
.sp
.B str_return:
Value is returned here
.sp
.B len_return:
Length of value is returned here
.TP
.B post: 
The str_key is looked up and the corresponding value is 
returned in str_return and len_return.
.TP
.B return:  
0 on success
.sp
\-1 on db access error
This inclides file, connection and other data access
errors. It does not cover memory allocation problems.
.sp
\-2 if key cannot be found in map
.sp
\-3 on other error
.TP
.B Note: 
The string returned in str_return should be of the 
form [<username><domain_delimiter>]<servername>[:<port>].
Setting the domain_delimiter is discussed in the \fBperdition\fP(8),
@ is used in the example.
.sp
E.g.: 
.sp
localhost:110
.br
user@localhost:110
.br
user@localhost
.br
localhost
.P
As the library is opened using the dlopen mechanism the libary
may also export functions \fB_init\fP and \fB_fini \fPthat will be
executed when the library is opened and closed respectively.
In addition if the symbols \fBint *(*dbserver_init)(char *)\fP and 
\fBint *(*dbserver_fini)(void)\fP are defined then these are run when 
the library is opened and closed respectivley.  If defined these 
symbols should have the following semantics.
.P
.B dbserver_init
.P
Initialise db as necessary
.TP
.B pre: 
.sp
.B options_str: 
Options string. The usage of this is implementation dependant.
.TP
.B post: 
db is intialised
.TP
.B return:  
0 on success
.sp
\-1 on db access error This inclides file, connection and other data access
errors. It does not cover memory allocation problems.
.sp
\-2 if key cannot be found in map
.sp
\-3 on other error
.P
.B dbserver_fini
.P
Shut down db as necessary
.TP
.B pre: 
none
.TP
.B post: 
db is shut down
.TP
.B return:  
0 on success
.sp
\-1 on db access error
This inclides file, connection and other data access
errors. It does not cover memory allocation problems.
.sp
\-2 if key cannot be found in map
.sp
\-3 on other error
.P
In addition, if a SIGHUP is sent to a process then a signal handler
will call dbserver_fini if it is defined and then
dbserver_init if it is defined. Note: dbserver_init will be 
called if defined, even if dbserver_fini is not defined.
.P
In the case of the posix regular expressions library this will
cause popmap.re to be reparsed, hence effecting any changes that have been
made to that file. For the GDBM library it will reopen the database and for
the other libraries it will reinitalise its connection to the database,
LDAP or NIS server.
.P
The shared library has access to the following global symbols exported 
by perdition.
.TP
.B struct utsname *system_uname  
The uname information for the system as per uname(2)
.TP
.B struct sockaddr_in *peername
The sockaddr_in for the connected client.
.TP
.B struct sockaddr_in *sockname 
The sockaddr_in for the local interface that the client connected to.
Note: Under Solaris 7 this is actually the sockaddr_in bound to, not the
interface the connection was accepted to.
.P
.SH DATABASE ACCESS LIBRARIES SHIPPED WITH PERDITION

.SH GDBM
This is the default library used by perdition.
.P
The gdbm library reads a users server and port information from a GDBM
database. The database is opened each time perdition needs to find the
server and port for a user.  The information for each user is stored in a
flat file, popmap with the format:
.P
<username>:[<username><domain_delimiter>]<hostname|ip address>[:<port number|service name>]
.P
A domain_delimiter of @ is used in this example. Setting the
domain_delimiter is discussed in the \fBperdition\fP(8).
.P
E.g.
.P
horms:foo.bar:110
.br
jain:jane@foo.bar
.P
To build the flat file into a binary format the makegdbm which is provided
as part of perdition is used. To rebuild the popmap run:
.P
makegdbm popmap.db < popmap
.P
Alternatively a makefile is provided in the source distribution in
etc/perdition/ and you can simply run \fBmake\fP in /etc/perdition to
rebuild the popmap. This is installed into /etc/perdition/ in the RPM
distribution.
.P
An alternate location for the popmap.db can be specified using the
\-m|\--map_library_opt command line option or configuration file directive.
.P
E.g.
.P
perdition \-m /etc/my_popmap.db
.P
.SH NIS
Ths NIS library reads a YP/NIS map, the key is the userid, the value is the
servername.
.P
The default map name is 'user_mail_server', and can be changed by
specifying the map name with the \-m flag.
.P
To use this library, you need to specify:
.P
perdition \-M /usr/lib/libperditiondb_nis.so.0
.P
Where \fB/user/lib\fP is the directory in which the perdition libraries
were installed.
.P
.BNote:
you will need to customise your yp server's Makefile to actually get
a new map on the server. This is intended for sites that already have a
significant infrastructure based around yp.
.SH POSIX REGULAR EXPRESSIONS
.P
The backerference substitution code in this library is courtesy 
of Wim Bonis <bonis@solution\-service.de> and in turn the PHP3
project.
.P
This library can be used by specifying the full path to the libary using
the \-M|\--map_library command line option or configuration file directive.
.P
E.g.
.P
perdition \-M /usr/lib/libperditiondb_posix_regex.so.0
.P
Where \fB/user/lib\fP is the directory in which the perdition libraries
were installed.
.P
The regular expression is kept in a flat file, by default
\fB/etc/perdition/popmap.re\fP .  A sample map file is shipped with the source
and can be found in etc/perdition/popmap.re, this is intalled into
/etc/perdition/popmap.re in the RPM distribution.  The format for the flat
file is:
.P
<regular expression>: [<username><domain_delimiter>]<server>[:<port>]
.P
Information on setting the domain_delimiter is found in \fBperdition\fP(8),
@ is used in this example.
.P
E.g.
.P
^[a\-k]: localhost
.br
^[^a\-k]: localhost:110
.br
^user: user2@localhost
.br
(.*)@(.*): $1_$2@localhost
.P
The first matching regular expression will be used. The regular expressions
are extended posix regular expressions. The last example illustrates
the ability to expand backreferances.
.P
E.g.
.P
For the regex (.*)@(.*): $1_$2@localhost
.br
bonis@solution\-service.de
.br
would return
.br
bonis_solution\-service_de@localhost
.P
Note that there is no implcit ^ or $
around the regular expressions. The popmap entry "flim: localhost" will
match "flim", "flimstix", "itsflim" and "totallyflimless". To only match
"flim" you need the popmap entry "^flim$: localhost".
.P
The map file is read once on startup and cached. This is to increase
performance as the regular expressions must be compiled internally before
they can be used. The map file can be re read by sending perdition as
SIGHUP.  An alternate location for the popmap.re can be specified using the
\-m|\--map_library_opt command line option or configuration file directive.
.P
E.g.
.P
perdition \-m /etc/my_popmap.re
.P
.SH MYSQL
Many thanks to Frederic Delchambre <dedel@freegates.be> for
his invaluable contribution to this library.
.P
As per Posix Regex, this library can be used by specifying the full path to
the libary using the \-M|\--map_library command line option or configuration
file directive.
.P
E.g.
.P
perdition \-M /usr/lib/libperditiondb_mysql.so.0
.P
Where \fB/user/lib\fP is the directory in which the perdition libraries
were installed.
.P
The library will connect to a MySQL database and do a query on a table
expected to have the columns:
.P
.nf
+\--\--\--\--\--\--+\--\--\--\--\--\--\--+\--\--\--+\--\--\-+\--\--\--\--\-+\--\--\--\-+
| Field      | Type         | Null | Key | Default | Extra |
+\--\--\--\--\--\--+\--\--\--\--\--\--\--+\--\--\--+\--\--\-+\--\--\--\--\-+\--\--\--\-+
| user       | varchar(128) |      | PRI |         |       |
| servername | varchar(255) |      |     |         |       |
| port       | varchar(8)   | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
+\--\--\--\--\--\--+\--\--\--\--\--\--\--+\--\--\--+\--\--\-+\--\--\--\--\-+\--\--\--\-+
.fi
.P
The fields may be in a different order and other, non\-perdition fields may
also be present in this table. The names of the columns can be other than
their above defaults by using the library option string (described below).
All fields must be literal character strings. The allowed length of the
strings is not important, however it is reccomended that the length of the
user field be kept under 128 to avoid exceeding perdition's internal query
length limit, PERDITIONDB_MYSQL_QUERY_LENGTH which is by default 256. This
may be altered by recompiling peridtion with an alternate value for this.
The user field must also be a unique index and an exact match will be made
of this field from the username supplied by the user.
.P
The servername is of the form [<username><domain_delimiter>]<host>, where
host is the hostname or IP address to connect to and username, if
specified, is the username to use when connecting to host.
.P
The port is the TCP port to use when connecting to the server. This field
can be specified if the backend server answers on a non\-standard port
(standard ports being 110 for POP3 and 143 for IMAP). Only specifiy this
field in the database if you intend to use POP3 or IMAP exclusively as it
will try to use this port no matter what protocol is being used. If POP3
and IMAP are both being used on non\-standard backend server ports, those
ports can be specified with the \-p argument when you invoke the perdition
executable (this is a global definition, but should be adequate for most
installations).
.P
The database is accesed each time perdition needs to find the host and port
for a user.  The default database values are as follows:
.P
database host:     localhost
.br
database port:     (MySQL Client Default; usually 3306)
.br
database name:     dbPerdition
.br
database table:    tblPerdition
.br
database user:     perdition
.br
database password: perdition
.br
user column:       user
.br
server column:     servername
.br
port column:       port
.br
.P
A script, perditiondb_mysql_makedb, is provided to initialise such a
database.  Alternate values can be set using the \-m|\--map_library_opt
command line option or configuration file directive with an argument of the
form:
.P
<dbhost>[:<dbport>[:<dbname>[:<dbtable>[:<dbuser>[:<dbpwd>[:<dbsrvcol>[:<dbusercol>[:<dbportcol>]]]]]]]]
.P
E.g.
.P
perdition \-m some.host.com:3306:aDb:bTable:cUser:dPassword:eSrvCol:fUserCol:gPortCol
.P
Arguments may be omitted from the end of the option string with no consequence other than
that the default value for any omitted argument will be used. Arguments may not be omitted if
any argument to its right is defined. Someone seeking to set only the server and password
to something other than the default might attempt the following:
.P
perdition \-m some.host.com:::::OddPassword
.P
This will not work. It will set the server and password to the values shown, but all arguments
in between will be set as NULL rather than the default. In the author's opinion it is always best
to specify \fBall\fP of the arguments, whether default or not, to avoid confusion or ambiguity.
.SH POSTGRESQL
.P
This is a port of the MySQL library to PostgreSQL, The library can be used
by specifying the full path to the libary using the \-M|\--map_library
command line option or configuration file directive.
.P
E.g.
.P
perdition \-M /usr/lib/libperditiondb_mysql.so.0
.P
Where \fB/user/lib\fP is the directory in which the perdition libraries
were installed.
.P
A script, perditiondb_postgresql_makedb is provided to initialise the
database.
.P
For more information please see the MySQL documentaion above.
.SH LDAP
This library allows access to LDAP based popmaps. This library can be used
by specifying the full path to the libary using the \-M|\--map_library
command line option or configuration file directive.
.P
E.g.
.P
perdition \-M /usr/lib/libperditiondb_ldap.so.0
.P
Where \fB/user/lib\fP is the directory in which the perdition libraries
were installed.
.P
A script is provided in etc/perdition/ldap/ to initialise an
LDAP popmap for the default URL.
In the RPM distrubution this can be found installed in
/etc/perdition/ldap/ . An alternate URL can be set using the
\-m|\--map_library_opt command line option or configuration file directive.
.P
The default URL is:
.P
ldap://localhost/ou=mailbox,dc=my\-domain,dc=com?username,mailhost,port?one?(uid=%25s)
.P
The URL should contain excactly one %s (%25s), which will be filled by the
name of the user when a query is made.
.P
A script, perditiondb_ldap_makedb is provided to initialise LDAP.
.P
