Entered-date:   09JAN01
Description:    Perdition is allows users to connect to a content-free 
                POP3 or IMAP4 server that will redirect them to their real 
                POP3 or IMAP4 server. This enables mail retrieval for a 
                domain to be split across multiple real pop servers on a 
                per user basis. This can also be used to as a POP3 or IMAP4
                proxy especially in firewall applications. Supports
                arbitrary library based map access to determine the server
                for a user. POSIX Regular Expression, GDBM,
                MySQL, PostgreSQL, NIS and LDAP libraries ship with 
		the distribution.
