perdition (0.1.10-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added Build-Depends on libtool and built package from
    a tar ball generated by make distcheck, rather than
    from my development tree. This means that files, rather
    than symlinks are included in the package. This should
    solve build problems reported.
