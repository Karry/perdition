perdition (1.17.1-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * New Upstream
    - Verify that tag read from end-users is valid
      + CVE-2007-5740
        The format string protection mechanism in IMAPD for Perdition Mail
        Retrieval Proxy 1.17 and earlier allows remote attackers to execute
        arbitrary code via an IMAP tag with a null byte followed by a format
        string specifier, which is not counted by the mechanism.
    - Merged in all changes made between 1.17-1 and 1.17-8 inclusive

 -- Simon Horman <horms@debian.org>  Wed, 31 Oct 2007 11:44:22 +0900

perdition (1.17-8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Change build-dependancy from libdb4.3-dev to libdb-dev,
    which currently depends on libdb4.6-dev. This is to allow
    libdb4.3 to be removed from the archive.
    (closes: #442663)

 -- Simon Horman <horms@debian.org>  Wed, 19 Sep 2007 11:30:32 +0900

perdition (1.17-7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Remove the unneccesary Build-Depends on automake as part of
    automake transition. http://wiki.debian.org/AutomakeTransition
    (closes: #376643)
  * Fix documentation of map_library. Thanks to Anand Kumria.
    (closes: #354527)
  * Add suggests perdition-ldap, perdition-mysql, perdition-odbc,
    perdition-postgresql to perdition
  * Update from standards version 3.6.1 to 3.7.2

 -- Simon Horman <horms@debian.org>  Tue,  4 Jul 2006 15:31:02 +0900

perdition (1.17-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Rebuild, as i386 upload was missing depenancies on vanessa libraries.
    This was caused by a ~/.magic in the build environment that had very
    unexpected side affects. Primarily causing file to return "data"
    instead of "ELF" on ELF executables, and thus causing all executables
    to be skipped by dh_shlibdeps.
    (closes: #344797)
  * Tell dh_shlibdeps that base libraries are in the perdition package
    and found in debian/perdition/usr/lib

 -- Simon Horman <horms@verge.net.au>  Tue, 27 Dec 2005 03:57:14 +0000

perdition (1.17-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Update MySQL build dependancy to libmysqlclient15-dev
    (closes: 343790)

 -- Simon Horman <horms@verge.net.au>  Mon, 19 Dec 2005 10:24:15 +0900

perdition (1.17-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Revert to using ldap_init() instead of ldap_initialize()
    which seems to be broken on debian's ldap, 2.1.30.
    I am not sure what version it works for, if any.
    http://www.openldap.org/lists/openldap-software/200406/msg00688.html

 -- Simon Horman <horms@debian.org>  Mon,  4 Jul 2005 21:29:28 +0900

perdition (1.17-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Build packet code for daemon modules as a shared module,
    else it brakes the build on smoe arches. This is an attempt
    at a more permanant solution to this problem, rather than
    the band-aid solution included in 1.15-5. 
    Thanks to Kurt Roeckx (closes: Bug#315771)
  * Forcibly disable build of ldap documentation.
  * Change build-dependancies on virtual packages to non-virtual packages
    - libdb-dev -> libdb4.3-dev
    - libmysqlclient-dev -> libmysqlclient14-dev
    Thanks to Kurt Roeckx

 -- Simon Horman <horms@debian.org>  Wed, 29 Jun 2005 11:50:38 +0900

  * New Upstream

 -- Simon Horman <horms@debian.org>  Wed, 22 Jun 2005 14:43:32 +0900

perdition (1.15-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Don't build packet code for deamon module as a staticly linked object,
    as introduced in 1.15-4, as this breaks building on some architectures.
    Instead, just omit building the sample client and server program,
    which are never installed anyway. (closes: Bug#291132)
 
 -- Simon Horman <horms@debian.org>  Wed, 19 Jan 2005 12:01:12 +0900

perdition (1.15-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Rebuilt with correct libary dependancies.
    It turns out that when 1.15-3 (and possibly other releases) were
    built the vanessa libraries were present in a local directory,
    as well /usr/lib, which caused some dependancies to be omitted.
    (closes:  Bug#290794)
  * Move shared packet code for deamon module into a staticly linked library
    as having multiple objects link against packet.o breaks the build
    sometimes.

 -- Simon Horman <horms@debian.org>  Mon, 17 Jan 2005 12:50:05 +0900

perdition (1.15-3) unstable; urgency=low

perdition (1.14release-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Ldap filter parsing code has been completely rewritten
    and should now allow substitutions in any part of the URL.
    (Actually this was fixed in 1.10, but I missed closing the bug report.)
    (closes: Bug#203734)
