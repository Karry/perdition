 allows a user database stored in a MySQL databse.

Package: perdition-nis
Architecture: any
Depends: perdition (= ${Source-Version})
Description: Library to allow perdition to access NIS based pop maps.
 Perdition allows for arbitrary user database access through
 shared libraries much in the maner of NSS in glibc. This package
 allows a user database to be sourced from NIS.
 .
 It is suggested that you use one of the other database modules instead of
 NIS unless you already have a NIS infrastructure.

Package: perdition-postgresql
Architecture: any
Depends: perdition (= ${Source-Version})
Description: Library to allow perdition to access PosgreSQL based pop maps.
 Perdition allows for arbitrary user database access through
 shared libraries much in the maner of NSS in glibc. This package
 allows a user database stored in a PostgreSQL databse.

Package: perdition-posix-regex
Architecture: any
Depends: perdition (= ${Source-Version})
Description: Library to allow perdition to access Posix Regular Expression based pop maps.
 Perdition allows for arbitrary user database access through
 shared libraries much in the maner of NSS in glibc. This package
 allows a user database to be expreses as a series of Posix Regular
 Expressions.

Package: perdition-dev
Architecture: any
Depends: perdition (= ${Source-Version}), libvanessa-logger-dev, libvanessa-adt-dev, libvanessa-socket-dev, libc6-dev
Description: Development libraries and headers for perdition
 Perdition allows for arbitrary user database access through
 shared libraries much in the maner of NSS in glibc. This package
 provides headers and libraries that may be useful in the development
 of perditiondb libraries.

Package: perdition
Architecture: any
Depends: libpopt0, libpam0g, libc6, perdition-gdbm  (= ${Source-Version})
Description: POP3 and IMAP4 Proxy server
 Perdition is allows users to connect to a content-free POP3 or IMAP4
 server that will redirect them to their real POP3 or IMAP4 server. This
 enables mail retrieval for a domain to be split across multiple backend
 servers on a per user basis. This can also be used to as a POP3 or IMAP4
 proxy especially in firewall applications. Perdition supports arbitrary
 library based map access to determine the server for a user. POSIX
 Regular Expression, GDBM, MySQL, PostgreSQL and LDAP libraries ship with
 the distribution.
