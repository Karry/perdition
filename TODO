     - On a global and per-user basis
     - Option for LOGINDISABLED capability for IMAP
   + Option to require specific cipher suites before authentication
*  Add TLS IMAP and POP Client support
   RFC:
      - Option to only use tls if advertised by server
      - Client checks
        - Copmare server hostname used to connect with that in certificate
	- Hostname must not be derived from an insecure source such as DNS
	- Matching is case sensitive
	- * wildcard for before first . is acceptable in certificate
	- Match any name in the certificate if there is more than one
	- If chack fails terminate
     - reissue CAPABILITY/CAPA command after intiating tls
     - honour LOGINDISABLED capability for IMAP
