From Daniel Rosen
* Specify a # as an option in a config file, currently it will
  be seen as a comment.
* Enable specification of syslog facility and non-sylog logging.
* Document that gdbm maps can be missing for a pure proxy

From Rob Wyn Jones
* Allow multiple servers for a user (or default) are connect to in series
  (rather than randomly)

From Krzysztof Sierota
* Method of evaluating if mailboxes are empty to avoid have to
  authenticate with the backend server. Method is yet to be determined :)

* Specifying map_library "" in perdition.conf does _not_ work.
* Merge buffered token reading code from supersparrow
