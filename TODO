From Chris Stratford
* Resolve Solaris (2.6) compile problems for perdition 0.1.9
  - There is no soclken_t. Use size_t instead ?
  - printf.h doesn't exist. No format string checking on Solaris ?

From Matt Prigge
* Modify the necessary Makefiles (etc/perdition/Makefile?) to keep 'make
  install' from overwriting the current configuration.
* Set the proctitle with the status of the program (whether it is
  listening, connected, what mode its in, that sort of thing) so that its
  easier to see what daemons are doing what.
* Introduce a new protocol labels for SIMAP4 and SPOP3.
* Make IMAP4 and POP3 act as an implicit "ssl_mode none"
